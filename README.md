# Animal-Chess

a turn-based two-player board game where the game board has a land, a trap, an animal den, and a river. Each player occupies one side of the board and has 8 starting pieces. Each piece is an animal with different ranks and some animals also have their own special moves. An animal can capture another animal with a rank equal to or lower than the current animal, unless the animal to be captured is trapped. A player can win if they get into the enemy's den, or if the opponent's pieces are all captured.
